Goob Sink is a vanila++ modpack for 1.20.1 Fabric, made by (and mostly for) members of DELUX SHAVE.

It's almost a kitchen sink pack, but we've tried to make things fit into vanilla as much as we could, while having a significant mod count.

A lot of the mods are preconfigured and their keybinds are set to not conflict. You can still configure them, but you most likely don't need to.
